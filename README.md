# Kobold
Python based discord bot that provides dice rolls and spell information on demand.

## How does Kobold work?
Kobold is built using the [discord.py libraries](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) and the [D&D REST API](http://dnd5eapi.co/api/) built by adrpadua.

## Known Issues
Spell stats may appear in sets and or lists (not ideal for reading).
